## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to abide by our Code of Conduct. Please be respectful and inclusive in all interactions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (version 3.8.1 or higher)
- Dart SDK
- Git
- An IDE (VS Code, Android Studio, or IntelliJ IDEA)
- OpenWrt router for testing (optional but recommended)

### Fork and Clone

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cogwheel0/luci-mobile.git
   cd luci-mobile
   ```
3. Add the upstream repository:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/cogwheel0/luci-mobile.git
   ```

## Development Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 2. Run the App

```bash
flutter run
```

### 3. Set Up Your Development Environment

- Install Flutter and Dart extensions in your IDE
- Configure your IDE for Dart/Flutter development
- Set up a code formatter (dart format)

### 4. Testing Environment

For testing with a real router:
- Set up an OpenWrt router with LuCI web interface
- Configure network access to the router
- Note the router's IP address for testing

## Coding Standards

### Dart/Flutter Standards

- Follow the [Dart Style Guide](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style)
- Use `flutter analyze` to check for issues
- Format code using `dart format`
- Follow Flutter best practices and conventions

### Code Organization

- Keep files focused and single-purpose
- Use meaningful file and class names
- Group related functionality together
- Follow the existing project structure

### Naming Conventions

- **Files**: Use snake_case (e.g., `api_service.dart`)
- **Classes**: Use PascalCase (e.g., `NetworkInterface`)
- **Variables**: Use camelCase (e.g., `ipAddress`)
- **Constants**: Use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_RETRY_COUNT`)

### Documentation

- Add comments for complex logic
- Document public APIs and methods
- Update README.md for significant changes
- Include examples for new features

## Pull Request Process

### 1. Create a Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Write clean, well-documented code
- Follow the coding standards
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed

### 3. Test Your Changes

```bash
# Run tests
flutter test

# Analyze code
flutter analyze

# Format code
dart format .

# Build for different platforms
flutter build apk
flutter build ios
```

### 4. Commit Your Changes

Use conventional commit messages:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add new dashboard widget"
git commit -m "fix: resolve authentication timeout issue"
git commit -m "docs: update API documentation"
```

### 5. Push and Create Pull Request

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then create a Pull Request on GitHub with:

- **Clear title** describing the change
- **Detailed description** of what was changed and why
- **Screenshots** for UI changes
- **Test instructions** for reviewers
- **Related issues** if applicable

### 6. Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused and small
